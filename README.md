========================

This project aims at providing Vagrant + Ansible recipes to build OBM instances.

Required dependencies
========================

* vagrant 1.3.5
* ansible 1.1
* virtualbox
* a 64 bits computer

How to use it ?
========================

It's usual vagrant stuff : just fetch the source code and run `vagrant up`, 
take a coffee break, and you get a fresh OBM instance running.

You can then connect to it at `https://<youripaddress>/`

What do you get ?

* a Debian Wheezy 64 bits
